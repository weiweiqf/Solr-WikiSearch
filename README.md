This project is for Stantec Coding Challenge which is instructed in Stantec Coding Challenge.txt.

Though the setup for Solr and Angular is listed in Solr & Angular Setup.txt, I compressed and uploaded the entire configured Solr 8.0.0 server and wiki project in solr-8.0.0-configured.zip and wiki.zip respectively, so that you can quickly uncompress these 2 files and run the server and the application.

After you uncompress the solr-8.0.0-configured.zip, please update the "url" attribute in ~\solr\server\solr\wiki\conf\data-config.xml accordingly.

If you encounter problems when running wiki project, please follow the Angular setup steps to setup the Angular environment as requited. Basically, it is to open a CMD window, go to the wiki folder, and install required Node.js and Angular packages listed in Solr & Angular Setup.txt.
